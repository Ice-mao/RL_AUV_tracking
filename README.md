# RL_AUV_tracking

A project for my major related graduation paper.

Using reinforcement learning(RL) to train an agent to tracking the target in the unknown underwater scenario in HoloOcean.

# Running

To run the simulation, first install all dependencies

- HoloOcean
- Stable Baseline3

Then simply run the script
```
python SB3_learning --choice 0 --render 0
```
maybe you should also add --map with you own map or HoloOcean scenario like SimpleUnderwater-Hovering.

## Additional information

If you want to know more details,you should read the code.:smiley:

Or please keep stay tuning!
